# Kim Bumsuk Portfolio

This repo contains an easy-to-customize personal dev portfolio template that was created with Sass and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.

## Sections

### About

In general, most styles on the page are based off the definitions of variables in the variable section of the style sheet:

```SCSS
// Define base and accent colors
$base-color: #3498db;
$base-color-hover: darken($base-color, 10%);

// Define background colors
$background: #fff;
$background-alt: #f2f2f5;

// Define border colors
$border: #dcd9d9;

// Define text colors
$heading: #374054;
$text: #74808a;
```

If you wish to change the general colour scheme of the page for example, simply change the value of `$base-color`.

There is also a number of default CSS classes that can be applied such as `.shadow`, `.shadow-large`, `.btn-rounded-white`, and various others. These can be found under the General Styles section in the style sheet.

### Achievement

By default, the template comes with a number of images, some of which can be kept and others which act simply as placeholders and should be switched. The template contains the following:

* Main background (images/lead-bg.jpg) - this is the main background image provided via [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). This can be kept or changed easily by replacing `images/lead-bg.jpg` with your new background (recommended size of at least 1920x1080).
* Favicon (/favicon.ico) - this is the favicon used for the page. Similar to the main bg, this can kept or changed easily by replacing the `favicon.ico` with your new one.
* Project image - these are the images associated with the projects under the project section. These are simply placeholders and should either be replaced or removed.

### Education

The header section can be found within the `<header>` tag and simply contains an unordered list of anchors to different sections of the page. If you add a new section and want to be able to quickly navigate to it from the top, simply add another list element with an anchor that has the href of the ID of the section. Conversely, if you remove a section, don't forget to remove the associated navigation element.

If you wish to add a header link to an external page, simply add the class `no-scroll` to the anchor. For example:

```HTML
<li>
    <a href="https://google.com" class="no-scroll">Google</a>
</li>
```

If you wish to have a sticky (fixed) header, you simply need to add a class of `sticky` to the main header. For example, that would be accomplished as follows:

```HTML
<header class="sticky">
    <!-- Header content -->
</header>
```

### Projects

The Lead section is pretty straightforward, it contains an h1 for your name and an h2 for your title. It also contains a link that can be used to link to your resume should you wish to add it as well.

If you want your resume to automatically download when the button is clicked instead of opening up in another tab (the default behaviour), add the following code (Thanks to jkfran for the suggestion) in the lead:

```HTML
<a href="path/to/resume.pdf" download="resume.pdf" class="btn-rounded-white">Download Resume</a>
```

The href attribute points to where your resume is stored and the download attribute is what triggers the download / provides the name the file will be downloaded as when the user clicks the button (In this case, it will download as resume.pdf).

### Skills

The about section contains a quick about blurb that can be edited by changing the text within the paragraph tags.

### Contact

The experience section creates a vertical timeline with all your relevant experience. The code for the timeline creation can be found within `js/scripts.js` and is an adaptaion of [RyanFitzgerald/vertical-timeline](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/vertical-timeline).

The default format is as follows:

```HTML
<div id="experience-timeline">
    <div data-date="September 2015 â€“ September 2016">
        <h3>Employer Name</h3>
        <h4>Job Title</h4>
        <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur in iaculis ex.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

The data attribute `data-date` is what is used to add a date to the associated timeline point. All that is really required is a wrapping div (i.e. `#experience-timeline`) and nested divs to build the timeline. The h3, h4, and p tags are optional and the contents of the div can be styled however you wish.

To add additional section, simply add additional nested divs under the main wrapping div.
